    "  - **Definition:** Measures the variability or spread of individual data points around the sample mean.\n",
    "  - **Interpretation:** A higher SD indicates more spread out data, while a lower SD signifies data points are closer to the mean.\n",
    "  - **Usage:** Describes the dispersion within the actual dataset, applicable to both population and sample data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Standard Error of the Mean (SEM):**\n",
    "  - **Definition:** Measures the precision of the sample mean as an estimate of the population mean.\n",
    "  - **Calculation:** \\( SEM = \\frac{SD}{\\sqrt{n}} \\), where \\( n \\) is the sample size.\n",
    "  - **Interpretation:** A smaller SEM suggests the sample mean is a more accurate estimate of the population mean. SEM decreases as sample size increases.\n",
    "  - **Usage:** Useful for constructing confidence intervals and conducting hypothesis tests related to the mean.\n",

    "  2. **Calculate Means**: Compute the mean of each bootstrap sample to create a distribution of bootstrap means.\n",
    "  3. **Compute Bootstrap SEM**: Calculate the standard deviation of the bootstrap means.\n",
    "  4. **Determine Confidence Interval**: Apply the SEM-based method using the bootstrap SEM to establish the 95% confidence interval, ensuring it encompasses approximately 95% of the bootstrap sample means.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **SD vs. SEM:** SD quantifies the variability within the data, whereas SEM quantifies the uncertainty in estimating the population mean from the sample mean.\n",
    "- **Confidence Intervals:** SEM is instrumental in constructing confidence intervals, providing a range that likely contains the true population mean with a specified level of confidence (e.g., 95%).\n",
    "- **Bootstrap Applications:** Bootstrap methods enhance the estimation of confidence intervals by empirically deriving the sampling distribution of the mean, offering robustness especially with smaller sample sizes or non-normal data distributions.\n",

Simply put, let's say we have a sample set of data, but we don't know what it really is. So, we create many new “virtual” samples by repeatedly randomly selecting from this set of sample data. We can then run calculations on these new samples to see what the results look like and to estimate the range of variation or uncertainty in the data. If you have a bag full of beans, and you grab a handful of beans from it, and you want to know the average number of beans in the whole bag, you can take a handful of beans from the bag. This is where I can grab from this handful of beans multiple times over, simulate multiple possible outcomes, and eventually get a rough idea of how reliably the bean situation in the first grab represents the entire bag."

With bootstrapping, we can create a large number of dummy samples to see the range of these statistics in different contexts, and then estimate the confidence intervals for the statistic to determine its range of fluctuation. For example, if you take a quiz and get a score, but if you take it a few more times, will the results be very different.

For example, when I encounter something I don't understand, I usually use ChatBot first, because it can give me some feedback and explanation immediately, which is quite convenient. If the answers ChatBot gives aren't enough, I'll go to Piazza to see what people are discussing. The combination of these methods allows me to grasp the content of the course in a more comprehensive way."
